# Grapple Boy

# About the Project
Our project aims to create an action-platformer title for the Bandai WonderSwan called _Grapple Boy_. In this game, you play as a character with a grappling hook and movement abilities and aim to utilize the abilities to find the quickest methods to beat levels. This game will be programmed in C with the assistance of the WonderWitch development kit which was specifically designed to develop for the WonderSwan system. Once development is complete, the WonderWitchâ€™s TransMagic software will allow us to put the game on a physical cartridge to be played on an actual WonderSwan system.

# Grapple Boy

## About the Project
Our project aims to create an action-platformer title for the Bandai WonderSwan called _Grapple Boy_. In this game, you play as a character with a grappling hook and movement abilities and aim to utilize the abilities to find the quickest methods to beat levels. This game will be programmed in C with the assistance of the WonderWitch development kit which was specifically designed to develop for the WonderSwan system. Once development is complete, the WonderWitchâ€™s TransMagic software will allow us to put the game on a physical cartridge to be played on an actual WonderSwan system.

## Built Using
- WonderWitch Development Kit
- C Programming Language
- Visual Studio Code
- Oswan
- Microsoft Paint
- Reference Code From: http://wwgp.qute.co.jp/2001/allworks/htm

## How To Try It

## Controls
On the Oswan emulator, different keys are used in substitution to the buttons on the actual WonderSwan system. Below will be a list of the controls of the game in context of using the Oswan emulator to play.

- C-Key: Jump. A basic platforming jump is performed upon pressing the C-Key.
- X-Key: Ability. One of the selected abilities is utilized. Further details on each of the gears will be provided later.
- Arrow Keys: Movement. Pressing the arrow keys allows for the player to move.
- W-Key: Hover. Fall slower through the air with increased horizontal mobility.
- A-Key: Sprint. Hold down while walking to enter a running animation.
- S-Key: Time Slow. Time is slowed down allowing the player make more precise movements.
- D-Key: Lunge. Perform a swift lunge forward to cover a vertical distance quickly either on the ground or in the air.

## Acknowledgements
  We would like to extend our gratitude to Dr. Michael Bixler of the Marine Academy of Technology and Environmental Science for the opportunity to create this passion project under the his supervision in the Computer Science Capstone Project class. Without the guidance he provided, this project would never have been able to become a reality the way it did.
